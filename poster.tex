            We introduce a novel pipeline called YAX which is used to assign taxonomy to provided samples. Whether it is a sample of dirt, subway grime, or your own gut, YAX will help to identify members of the community using high throughput metagenomic shotgun sequences.

        \begin{block}{Purpose}
            To provide a dynamic solution to the process of taxonomic assignment. Rather than relying on one single purposed solution
            YAX relies on configration files to not only describe a single run of the tool but to describe the pipeline itself. In this
            way altering YAX to use slightly procesess is a trivial matter of developing an Artifact type and Module then including this
            module in the architectural configuration when bootstrapping the YAX State System. In intention of the current configuration
            of the YAX pipeline is to present the Biologist with data rather than conclusions. By offering as much releveant, qualifying
            data as possible the expertise of the biologist can be leverage rather than relying on an automated process.

        \begin{block}{Future Work}
            YAX is designed to be highly modular and capable of adapting along side technological developments. As part of its development
            YAX was built to not only provide one solution but to investigate a number of possible solutions. The near future of YAX will
            see new modules developed to make fool use of its flexibility.
